Community Patches
-----------------
DockPanel Suite has a very strong developer community where people fork and
refine this library with bug fixes and new features. As maintainers, instead of
waiting for pull requests we evaluate such commits from time to time and merge
them if they are mature and really useful.

However, it would be difficult to assert the quality of such patches,
especially when we cannot easily contact the original developers or fully
understand the code base.

Patch Controller Design
-----------------------
In order to make patch evaluation more efficient, a mechanism called Patch
Controller is designed for 2.11+.

This allows us to ship selected patches and turn them on by default, which
gives a bigger audience opportunities to play with the patches. It would be
more likely that we receive bug reports and feedbacks on such patches. Of
course, this mechanism also allows users to disable the patches individually.

To disable all patches, the following code can be used,

.. code-block:: csharp

  PatchController.EnableAll = false;

To disable all patches without modifying source code, the following custom
section can be used in ``app.config``,

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
  <configuration>
    <configSections>
      <section name="dockPanelSuite" type="WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.Configuration.PatchSection, Tests3"/>
    </configSections>
    <dockPanelSuite enableAll="false" />
  </configuration>

To disable a patch in code, such as the HiDPI patch, the following code can be
used,

.. code-block:: csharp

  PatchController.EnableHighDpi = false;

To disable a patch such as the HiDPI patch without modifying source code, the
following section can be used in ``app.config``,

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
  <configuration>
    <configSections>
      <section name="dockPanelSuite" type="WeifenLuo.WinFormsUI.Docking.Configuration.PatchSection, Tests3"/>
    </configSections>
    <dockPanelSuite enableHighDpi="false" />
  </configuration>

To disable a patch such as the HiDPI patch via environment variable, please set
"DPS_EnableHighDpi" to "false".

To disable a patch such as the HiDPI patch via registry key, please create a
key named "Software\DockPanelSuite", and create a string value named
"EnableHighDpi" which should be set to "false".

Current Patches in Testing
--------------------------
There are several patches included in 2.11 for testing. They are,

* `GitHub #155 a focus lost fix <https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/321>`_
* `GitHub #291 an exception fix <https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/291>`_
* `GitHub #318 a flicker fix <https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/318>`_
* `GitHub #320 a HiDPI fix <https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/320>`_
* `GitHub #321 a memory leak fix <https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/issues/321>`_

More might be added in the next few weeks before the final release.

The magic words to disable them can be found in `this source file <https://github.com/dockpanelsuite/dockpanelsuite/blob/master/WinFormsUI/Docking/PatchController.cs>`_ .
